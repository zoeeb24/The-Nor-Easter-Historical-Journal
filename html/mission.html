    <h1> Our Mission </h1>

    <p>

We are Lucy Howe, Hannah Prue, and Zoe Bertsch and we are current seniors at Portland High School and co-founders of the Nor’Easter High School Historical Journal. Over the past year and a half, we have been working closely with Gavin Glider, U.S. History and Criminal Justice teacher at PHS. As many of you probably know, a capstone project is required for us to graduate.
<br>
<br>
In our sophomore year, we had the honor and opportunity to present research done in our APUSH class at the bi-annual New England Historical Association (NEHA) conference, held at UMaine Orono. Over the summer, a similar opportunity arose at a second NEHA conference, this time held at Roger Williams University in Bristol, Rhode Island. At both conferences, we attended seminars, spoke to graduate students and professors, and learned about the history of Maine, New England, and beyond. Most importantly, however, we, as highschool students, were able to present at a regional conference. It was safe to say that we were the only three high school students there. 
<br>
<br>
Either compelled by our work or just simply interested in learning about high school research, several attendees at both conferences asked us where our work was published, as they wanted to learn more. To this inquiry, we had to sadly report that it was not yet published anywhere and let them know we could email them a copy. 
<br>
<br>
​Our idea and our current mission is to create an outlet for students wishing to share their hard work and research in a published historical journal, one made specifically for high school students. We hope this appeals to those interested in a community of discussion, discourse, and discovery with those they can relate to the most.
