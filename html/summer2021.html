    To our readers:

Thank you so much for being a part of our first edition of the Nor’Easter Historical Journal. Our mission is to provide a place where high school student research and writing can be accessible and celebrated. We started this project in May of 2019 while presenting research from our AP United States History Class at the Maine Bicentennial celebration. During that event, we were asked many times about a forum where people could read more papers like ours. At that time, such a forum did not exist. Inspired by a lack of availability for high school students to showcase their historical research, we began to plan and create a journal of our own. We worked closely with Gavin Glider, our AP United States History teacher, on going through the steps it would take to create a historical journal. After a couple years of planning, developing, and working, we are very proud to present the first edition of the Nor’Easter. This edition highlights writing from students of Maine’s own Portland High School. Each of these students spent many hours researching, both in libraries and in archives, planning, writing and editing their papers. It is our hope to be able to expand the journal to reach more students and inspire more teachers to teach archival research techniques and instill a passion for academic writing. 
Thank you so much for your support, we hope you enjoy this edition of the Nor’Easter!
