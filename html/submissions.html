      <h1> Submissions </h1>

      <p>

        ​Our submissions are closed until further notice, as our current issue has just been released. Although we are not accepting papers at this time, we are always looking ahead to our next issues. Any interested high school student may contact us with questions and submission proposals at any time, although new papers will not be added to already completed issues. Below are some general guidelines regarding paper length, format, and submission procedures. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Papers should be researched based, but may cover any part of history, world or U.S. A ten page minimum (roughly 2,000 words) is required, this not including footnotes or quotations. 
      <br>
      <br>
        Among the many ways to format a paper, we often prefer Chicago or MLA 8 format. For more details about formatting, visit <a href="www.owl.purdue.edu ">www.owl.purdue.edu </a> for assistance.
      <br> 
      <br>
        Any inquiries regarding upcoming submission deadlines for possible later issues should be sent to <a> noreasterjournal@gmail.com </a>
